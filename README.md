!

....................................!
```

Created 4 log files.

### 2. Close the Book with AutoSave On

```powershell
[info] 20230207T080123.030281 [Changed] "C:\Users\USERNAME\notebooks\Excel\Book1.xlsx" < ""
```

### 3. Open the Book, and edit it with AutoSave On

```powershell
[info] 20230207T080424.085003 [Renamed] "C:\Users\USERNAME\notebooks\Excel\{2368CE5C-DB74-415A-B2A8-6AD5E69778BA}.tmp" < "C:\Users\USERNAME\notebooks\Excel\Book1.xlsx"
!
[info] 20230207T080424.085003 [Renamed] "C:\Users\USERNAME\notebooks\Excel\Book1.xlsx" < "C:\Users\USERNAME\notebooks\Excel\~$Book1.tmp"
```

Created 1 log file.
A save operation didn't use the Changed event. It was treated as two consecutive rename operations.

### 4. Edit the Book and save it without AutoSave Off

```powershell
[info] 20230207T080718.741760 [Renamed] "C:\Users\USERNAME\notebooks\Excel\{17EA83AD-3066-4C08-A7E4-A070927CB7E7}.tmp" < "C:\Users\USERNAME\notebooks\Excel\Book1.xlsx"
!
[info] 20230207T080718.742760 [Renamed] "C:\Users\USERNAME\notebooks\Excel\Book1.xlsx" < "C:\Users\USERNAME\notebooks\Excel\~$Book1.tmp"
```

Created 2 log files.
Even in this case, the save operation did not use the Changed event.

### 5. Close the Book without AutoSave Off

```powershell
[info] 20230207T080814.455450 [Changed] "C:\Users\USERNAME\notebooks\Excel\Book1.xlsx" < ""
```

Somehow the Changed event fired.ðŸ¤”

```
